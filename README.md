# Another SDXL artist browser?!

Yes, because it's better:
### Most complete database of tags
* Each artist has at least 6 tags
* Mediums, styles, themes, periods, subject matter, and more
### Largest database of artists: ~~3000k~~ (temporarily 500 due to beta)
* Sort artists by random to discover new ones
* Browse image thumbnails and view at full resolution
* Three images each: 🎨 artwork, 🧑 portrait, and 🏞️ landscape
### Easiest to use filters
* Sort filters by name or count of matches
* Choose strict or permissive when combining filters
### Save your favorites
* Export or import your favorites too
### Community first
* Transparent: Open source Creatives Commons database
* Private: No cookies, nothing sent to server, use offline
* Note: I can't control what data Huggingface collects
